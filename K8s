* What are the main components of Kubernetes architecture? 
- Kubernetes architecture exists in two parts: Control Plane/ Master node and Worker node. 
  The control plane has 4 components: Kube-API Server, Kube-Scheduler, Kube Controller Manager, and ETCD.
  The Worker Node has Kubelet, Kube Proxy, and Container Runtime. 
  The kube-api server is the central hub of the Kubernetes cluster that exposes the Kubernetes API. End users, and other cluster components, 
   talk to the cluster via the API server. 
  The kube-scheduler is responsible for scheduling pods on worker nodes.
  Kube Controller Manager is responsible for running multiple controllers that maintain the desired state of the cluster.
  The complete database of the Kubernetes cluster is stored in etcd.
  kubelet interacts with both the container runtime as well as the Node. It is the process responsible for starting a pod with a container inside.
  A container runtime is needed to run the application containers running on pods inside a pod. 
   Kube-proxy contains on each node of the Kubernetes cluster and facilitates Kubernetes networking services inside and outside of the cluster. 
  We used K8s version 1.27

* What is Deployment K8s and Why?
- There are multiple reasons for the deployment of Kubernetes
  Deployment provides us the capability to upgrade the application or pods seamlessly, using rolling updates, undo changes, and pause and resume changes as required.

* What are Taint and toleration? why it is required?
- Taints and Tolerations are used to set restrictions on what pods can be scheduled on a node.
  No Unwanted pods will be placed on the tainted node. only toleration-configured pods can be placed on the tainted node. 
  Taints are for Nodes and Toleration for pods.
  3 conditions: No Schedule | Prefer NoSchedule | No Execution

* What is Node Affinity?
- The primary feature of Node affinity is to ensure that the pods are hosted on particular nodes.

* What are Demon Sets? Why it is used?
- DaemonSet is a Kubernetes feature that lets you run a Kubernetes pod on all cluster nodes. Every time a new node is added to a cluster, the pod is added to it, 
  and when a node is removed from the cluster, the pod is removed. This can be used as a monitoring agent and Logs Viewer or log collector.




What is Configmap in K8s?
A Kubernetes ConfigMap is an API object that allows you to store data as key-value pairs.
