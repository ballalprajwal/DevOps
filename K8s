* What are the main components of Kubernetes architecture? 
- Kubernetes architecture exists in two parts: Control Plane/ Master node and Worker node. 
  The control plane has 4 components: Kube-API Server, Kube-Scheduler, Kube Controller Manager, and ETCD.
  The Worker Node has Kubelet, Kube Proxy, and Container Runtime. 
  The kube-api server is the central hub of the Kubernetes cluster that exposes the Kubernetes API. End users, and other cluster components, 
   talk to the cluster via the API server. 
  The kube-scheduler is responsible for scheduling pods on worker nodes.
  Kube Controller Manager is responsible for running multiple controllers that maintain the desired state of the cluster.
  The complete database of the Kubernetes cluster is stored in etcd.
  kubelet interacts with both the container runtime as well as the Node. It is the process responsible for starting a pod with a container inside.
  A container runtime is needed to run the application containers running on pods inside a pod. 
   Kube-proxy contains on each node of the Kubernetes cluster and facilitates Kubernetes networking services inside and outside of the cluster. 
  We used K8s version 1.27

What is Configmap in K8s?
A Kubernetes ConfigMap is an API object that allows you to store data as key-value pairs.
