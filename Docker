* What is docker? 
- Docker is an opensource containerization platform, it enables the developers to package applications into containers.  

* What is the docker container and how it is different from Virtual machine? 
~ VMs run as virtual environments on the same hardware with individual OS layer, whereas Docker runs on virtualizations of the same operating system. 

* What is Dockerfile? 
- A Dockerfile is a text document that contains set of instructions or commands that is used to assemble a docker image.  

* What are docker images? 
- Docker images act as a set of instructions to build a docker container.  

* What is CMD vs ENTRYPOINT command in Dockerfile?  
- CMD: sets default parameters that can be overridden by passing the values when container launches. 
  ENTRYPOINT: Default parameters that cannot be overridden when container runs. If we pass the value when we run the container, then that value will run along with the
  entrypoint value. 
  
* What is the difference between ADD and COPY commands in Dockerfile? 
- COPY provides just the basic support of copying local files into the container whereas ADD provides additional features like remote URL and tar extraction support. 

* Can you write a Dockerfile for Java Based Application?
- To dockerize the Java Application we need to write Dockerfile and also we need code with filename.java format. Here is the Docker file.  

          .......................... 
          FROM openjdk 
          WORKDIR /app 
          COPY . /app 
          RUN javac sample.java 
          CMD ["java""sample"] 
          ........................ 
  After writing the dockerfile Run these command: 
   + docker build -t Myjavaapp . 
   + docker Run -itd --name java1 Myjavaapp
