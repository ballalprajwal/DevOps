* What is AWS Cloudfront ? Why we need to use Cloudfront? 
- AWS Cloudfront is a globally distributed content delivery network that securely delivers content to the end users with high transfer speed and low latency. 
  CloudFront will cache the website content on various edge locations around the world and whenever the request comes from end users, these edge locations will deliver
  the content in order to lower the latency and improves the performance.   

* What are Security Group and NACL? 
- Security Group: It is acts as virtual firewall used to allow any particular traffic to an instance. Since it is stateful, if we allow the incoming traffic , 
  then outgoing traffic will be automatically allowed. 
  
  Network Access Control List (NACL): NACL is acts as Virtual firewall for subnet level. We need to allow or deny the traffic for both incoming and outgoing traffic. 
  Since it is stateless we need explicitly enter the rule for both incoming and outgoing.  

* What is VPC, Subnet , Route Tables ?
- Virtual Private CLoud (VPC): VPC is logically isolated network infrastructure that we can create on AWS cloud so that we can launch the AWS Resources into a 
  virtual network that we have defined.
  So we can setup subnets, Route tables, IGW, Elastic IP, NAT Gateway, Private and Public Network in the VPC based on the requirement. 
  
  Subnet: Subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network. The practice of dividing a network into multiple networks is called subnetting.   
  
  There are 2 types of subnets: 
  Public Subnet: The resources in this subnet can communicate with internet. 
  Private Subnet: The resources in this subnet is hidden from the internet. 

  Route Tables: Route Tables contains a set of rules called routes, that are used to determine where the network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.  

* What is Elastic IP , Internet Gateway, NAT gateway? 
- Elastic IP: An Elastic IP address is a reserved public IP address that you can assign to any instances, that will persist even if the instances are stopped.  
  
  Internet Gateway (IGW): Internet gateway is the component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet. 

  NAT Gateway (Network Address Translation) : It is the component that connects the instances in the private subnet to the services outside the VPC and restricts the 
  incoming traffic from external services.  

* What is Cloudtrail and Cloudwatch? 
- Cloudtrail: It is the complete track or logs of each and every event on the AWS account. It can record the information like username, IP address, Time, date event name, 
  resource name, etc of each and every event on the account, and the logs saves in S3 bucket.  

  Cloudwatch: It is a monitoring tool that mainly concerned with what's happening with AWS resources so that we can responds to it.  
 
  Cloudwatch has these features: 

    Cloudwatch Alarms: 
    Cloudwatch Logs: 
    Cloudwatch Metrics: 
    Cloudwatch events: 

* What is IAM ? What are, Users, User Groups, IAM role, IAM policies ? 
- IAM is a permission system that regulates access to AWS resources and services.  

  4 Key concepts  in IAM: 
  Users: IAM User represents an individual entity or person who can interact with AWS using IAM User credentials. 
  User Groups: User Group is a collection of users with the common theme. 
  IAM Role: IAM Role is an IAM identity with collection of permission policies which can be used to interact with AWS based on the permissions defined.  
  IAM Policies:  IAM Policies are the specific low level permission for access to AWS resources or services which has either allow or deny the permission to resources.  

* What are the layers in Lambda function?
  Lambda layer can be code, libraries , custom runtime or other dependencies. you can upload layer once and reference within any lambda function.
