* How to create or initialize git repository? 
- Use git init command and a file .git will be created 

* What is fork? 
- You make an own copy of entire code in multiple locations.  

* What is the difference between clone and fork? 
- Fork is used to keep a copy of the repo and clone is used to download the repo. 

* What is the difference between Git pull and Git fetch? 
- Git pull is to download the latest update from the repo. 
  Git Fetch will show the latest changes that are made in the repository, It will not download to local repository.  

* What is your branching strategy?
- We use git flow branching stratergy:
  In Gitflow, there is one main development branch called develop, with strict access enforced. When developer wants to add new feature, 
  they create a feature branch off the develop branch. Once the development of the feature is completed, the developer creates a pull request against the develop branch, 
  prompting for feedbacks from other developers. The branch is merged in after all the comments on the pull request is addressed. When the business decides the new feature 
  needs to release to customers Then it will merge to the release branch. The branch undergoes heavy testing, possible bug fixes, and is prepared to be merged into 
  the master branch. The master branch holds the production codes, which is consumed by other application teams as a dependency or used by customers.
  
- Trunk based Branching Strategy:
  In trunk based, all developers work off the master branch as the main branch. When the developer wants to add a new feature, they create a feature branch from the master
  branch. Once development of the feature is completed, the developer creates a pull request against the master branch. Prior to merging, the branch must compile and 
  pass unit or integration tests. Like the GIT Flow model, the master branch holds the productions codes and latest codes releases. 
----------------------------------------

* What is the difference between Git merge and Git rebase?
- Merge tracks the entire history of commits, while rebase rewrites a new one.

* What is the difference between .git and .gitignore ? 
- .git is everything in git, it will have the all the information about the repository. .gitignore is if you want to ignore any particular file while committing 
   then you have to update it in .gitignore file.  
   

- What is your merging stratergy ? 



What is the difference between merge --squash and rebase?

What is git stash & git Stash pop? 
Git stash is to pause the current edit on the branch and save it for tempararily, So that we can switch the branch without commiting the changes.

Stash Pop is used to switch back to the state where we saved the code temporarily. 

Pull Request. 

What will happen when you have conflict when you commit the code? 

Colaborate with developer to resolve.
