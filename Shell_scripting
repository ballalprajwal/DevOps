1. Write a script to report the usage of AWS in your project? 
- I have configured a bash script to report the usage of resources in AWS and configured cronjob to send the report every day 5pm to the external tool : 

#!/bin/bash 
// List s3 buckets 
 echo "print list of s3" 
 aws s3 ls 
 // list all ec2 instances 
 echo "print list of ec2" 
 aws ec2 describe-instances | jq '.Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceId' 
 // list all lambda functions 
 aws lambda list-functions 
 // list iam users 
 echo " List of Users::" 
 aws iam list-users | jq '.Users[].UserName'

2. Simple script using IF- else:

#!/bin/bash

then
        echo "Both variables are the same"
else
        echo "Both variables are different"
fi

3. John is working as a DevOps engineer at Amazon and he noticed that Amazon has 10000 VMs, For some reason he needs to manage 
all of these VMs and he needs to monitor the node health of VMs. Instead of going to the VMs every time and manually checking
the Memory issue, CPU utilization, and Running Process, He can make use of the Shell script. he can write one simple shell 
script and save the git repository, And when the DevOps engineer says that there is an issue with VM9999, So he can update 
the VM info in the script and run that shell script, SO that it will automatically log into the VM9999 and looks into the  
Memory issue, CPU utilization, running processors. and generate a report on the issue. and also he can also configure it with
cron jobs and check the node health of all of the VMs frequently and send a report through email. 

#!/bin/bash

# This Script outputs the node health

set -x           # debug mode
set -e           # exit the script when there is an error.
set -o pipefail  # is used to read all the commands on pipeline.
df -h
free -g
nproc
ps -ef | grep amazon | awk -F" " '{print $2}'   # print the process ID of the running processors
