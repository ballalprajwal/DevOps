*  What are the security measures that you taken in your project? 
-  we will take multiple security messures in the projects
   1. In the userend I will implement authentication. 
   2. I will secure the data using SSL/TLS.  
   3. Encrypt the data at rest using KMS. 
   4. Implementing  RBAC and specifying separate roles for separate group( admin, developer, tester etc ). 
   5. Using NACL and Security group We can regulate the traffic coming in/out to the server.  
   6. Keeping the database and application server in the private subnet and only exposing the load balancers on the public subnet.
   7. Placing the WAF behind the load balancers to secure the application from unauthorized access.
   8. We use guard duty to detect the suspicious activity in the network.  
   9. Use Crowdstrike for continuous monitoring.
   10. Use firewall in the application level such as palo-alto firewall. 
   11. make use of services like Sheild to protect from DDOS.
   12. Using monitoring tools like Splunk, Cloudwatch , Nagios to observe the infra.

*  How did you do DR for your Cloud application? 
   There are different option to choose DR from depending on RTO and RPO, There are 4 different strategies, 
   1.Backup & restore , 2.Pilot light, 3.warm standby, 4.Multisite active-active for realtime.
   For example: I have 2 load balancers in 2 different region those will be front end or application server, Route53 can send the 
   traffic to appropriate region based on the latency based routing, even if one server goes down route53 will automatically sends all 
   the traffic to other region. And for the database if I use dynamoDB I will use dynamoDB global table, it will automatically replicate 
   along with continuous backup.  

* Explain the 3 tier architecture ?
